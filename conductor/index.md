## Development Philosophy

-   **Absolute Completion:** No half-baked features. Every tool must have a clear input, output, and value prop.
-   **Real Revenue:** Focus on features that drive conversions (e.g., saved sessions, PDF exports, team collaboration).
-   **AI Native:** Hybrid approach combining deterministic logic with LLM refinement.
-   **UI/UX Polish:** Framer Motion, loading states, error boundaries, and responsive design are mandatory.
